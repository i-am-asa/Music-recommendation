# Music-recommendation
In this Python-driven music recommendation project, I utilized Spotify's dataset and implemented sentiment analysis to discern the emotional context of each track. The model was further trained on a Twitter dataset to categorize and analyze user sentiment. The interactive system prompts users for their current mood through a comment and their preferred genre. Leveraging this information, the model predicts and suggests a curated playlist tailored to the user's emotional state and music preferences. This project seamlessly integrates sentiment analysis and machine learning to deliver a personalized and engaging music recommendation experience.
