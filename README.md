# Music-recommendation
In this Python-driven music recommendation project, I utilized Spotify's dataset and implemented sentiment analysis to discern the emotional context of each track. The model was further trained on a Twitter dataset to categorize and analyze user sentiment. The interactive system prompts users for their current mood through a comment and their preferred genre. Leveraging this information, the model predicts and suggests a curated playlist tailored to the user's emotional state and music preferences. This project seamlessly integrates sentiment analysis and machine learning to deliver a personalized and engaging music recommendation experience.

In the development of this music recommendation project, I leveraged the Twitter API to obtain a relevant dataset for training the sentiment analysis model. The incorporation of real-time Twitter data enriches the model's understanding of user sentiment, providing a dynamic and up-to-date source for training and analysis. This integration ensures the project's adaptability to evolving trends and user expressions. Please refer to the project documentation for details on how to configure and use the Twitter API for obtaining the necessary dataset.
